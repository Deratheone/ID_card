# ID Card Lanyard Simulation

A visually realistic, interactive 3D ID card and lanyard simulation built with Three.js.

## Features
- Realistic ID card with modern, clean layout (no photo, QR, or barcode)
- Animated, fabric-like lanyard ribbon with dynamic waving motion
- Metallic ring and carabiner-style clip for added realism
- Drag-and-drop interaction with physics-based swinging and bouncing
- Beautiful lighting and soft shadows

## Demo
Open `index.html` in your browser to view the simulation.

## Controls
- **Drag the card**: Click and drag the card to interact with the lanyard and see realistic motion.

## Technologies Used
- [Three.js r128](https://threejs.org/)
- Custom physics (Verlet integration)
- HTML5 Canvas for card texture

## Customization
- Edit your name, title, and email in the `setupIDCard()` method in `index.html`.
- Adjust lanyard, card, or lighting parameters in the same file for different looks.
